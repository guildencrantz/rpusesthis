        <h2 id="who-am-i">Who Am I?</h2>
<p>My name is Rosemary Walsh and I am on the Service Operations team in New York working to improve and streamline service efficiencies. Previously at Return Path I have been both an Account Manager and a Client Success Expert. Before coming to Return Path, I worked at two different ESPs – <a href="http://www.whatcounts.com/">WhatCounts</a> and <a href="http://www.fishbowl.com/">Fishbowl</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-hardware-do-i-use">What Hardware Do I Use?</h2>
<p>I use a Dell notebook that runs Windows for work. I have a <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-2/specs/">black, 16GB Wi-Fi iPad 2</a> at home. My iPad is always in a <a href="http://www.dodocase.com/products/dodocase-custom-cases">DODOcase I customized</a> to be Hot Coral on the outside, Teal on the inside, with a Gray elastic. I also use a <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/">gold, 16GB iPhone 5s</a>. I also use my <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/eos_slr_camera_systems/eos_digital_slr_cameras/eos_rebel_t1i_ef_s_18_55mm_is_kit">Canon EOS Rebel T1i</a> (with both the standard <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_s_17_55_f_2_8_is_usm">EF-S 17-55 f/2.8 IS USM</a> lens and a <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_75_300mm_f_4_5_6_iii_usm">EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III USM</a> telephoto zoom lens) for taking digital photos, but have found myself using the iPhone camera more and more as the quality of the camera improves.</p>

<h2 id="what-software-do-i-use">What Software Do I Use?</h2>

<p>As organization and documentation are key to success in my role, I spend a lot of time using Google products. I use <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a> for my web browser, which I especially enjoy because I can login on different computers and have access to the same bookmarks, passwords, etc. I also rely heavily on Google Drive for the docs and spreadsheets, as well as my Google Calendar. Google Hangouts is my preferred means of online communication. I like that it stores all of your chats so that you can go back and look through the history. I find that I do this a lot when I know that I talked to someone about something but can’t remember the exact details. I have Google Hangouts integrated with <a href="https://www.trillian.im/">Trillian</a> to be able to chat with all Return Path folks.</p>

<p>For tracking projects and status updates, I follow along <a href="https://trello.com/‎">Trello</a> but find it ineffective for my own day to day use. Instead, I find myself typing notes in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad_(software)">Notepad</a> daily. I spend a lot of time in Salesforce, and especially enjoy the ability to stay connected with others through <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/chatter/overview/‎">Chatter</a>. During the day, I usually listen to <a href="https://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a>, although I enjoying listening to <a href="http://rainycafe.com/">Rainy Cafe</a> and <a href="http://www.rainymood.com/">Rainy Mood</a> to help focus (you may have seen me Chatter about that). I am a big fan of <a href="http://inboxzero.com/">Inbox Zero</a> at work, but I have over 900 emails in my personal Gmail account and have <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/storage">purchased additional storage</a> for the photos, documents, etc.</p>

<p>I like to rely on <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> on the web, <a href="https://about.twitter.com/products/list">my phone, and my tablet</a> for my news updates and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> for photo updates. I use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Services-LLC-Prime/dp/B00DBYBNEE">Amazon Prime</a> for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Prime-Instant-Video/b?node=2676882011">streaming shows</a> and the free shipping, of course! I recently got a <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en-US/chrome/devices/chromecast/">Chromecast</a>, although have so far found it ineffective since it has a limited number of apps that it can stream.</p>

<p>When running I use the <a href="http://www.mapmyrun.com/">MapMyRun</a> app for tracking my route, accompanied by Spotify or <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> for the music. I also have the <a href="http://www.moves-app.com/">Moves</a> app constantly running on my phone in the background to track my movements (walking the dog, walks to the train, etc.) It’s amazing how much you move in a given day!</p>

<p>I am in the midst of planning my wedding, so I also spend a good amount of personal time on Google Drive to share documents with my fiancé or family and friends. I created a <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/87809">Google Form</a> to collect addresses that then fed the data into a Google Sheet. This was a major time saver! I also use <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a> for inspiration, as well as recipes for home. I have used <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a> a lot recently for uploading and editing photos.</p>
