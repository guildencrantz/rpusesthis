        <h2 id="who-are-you-and-what-do-you-do">Who are you, and what do you do?</h2>

<p>I’m Nickolaus Casares, UX Designer, and I work on a team of designers that help deliver B2B software.</p>

<p>I’ve been involved with design of some form or another for close to 15 years and was a sound engineer in a previous life.</p>

<h2 id="what-hardware-do-you-use">What hardware do you use?</h2>

<p>At work, I use a 13” MacBook Pro connected to a 23” Dell monitor. At home, I use a 13” <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>. On the go, I use an <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/">iPhone 5s</a>, an old <a href="http://amzn.com/B004HFS6Z0">Kindle Keyboard</a> and a <a href="http://www.moleskine.com/en/collections/model/product/plain-notebook-large">large, plain Moleskine notebook</a>. The iPhone doubles as my camera because as they say, “the best camera is the one you have”.</p>

<p>I try to keep my hardware simple and independent of extra gadgetry. I regularly take public transit to work so keeping my setup light and portable is important.</p>

<h2 id="and-what-software">And what software?</h2>

<p>I’ve tried a lot of software over the years, and lately I’ve been keeping it fairly simple.</p>

<p>For productivity, I use Gmail, Outlook (at work), Google Docs, <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote </a> and <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>. Whenever possible, I try to use cloud versions of software so I can make a seamless transition between computers.</p>

<p>Gmail, Outlook, Evernote and Trello are probably the most used tools and form the core of my communication, note taking and task management systems.</p>

<p>I strive for <a href="http://inboxzero.com/">Inbox Zero</a>, and I’ve honed my ability to follow the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/use-the-two-minute-rule-to-stop-procrastinating-and-get-1521792128">two minute rule</a>. I tend to delete more than I archive, but I keep temporary project folders for work in progress and items that need to be tracked for follow up. I keep one massive archive folders (organized alphabetically) for projects and reference material.</p>

<p>I’m a huge fan of <a href="http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd">Getting Things Done</a>, and I’ve tried at least a dozen systems over the past five years. After much experimentation, I’ve settled on Evernote as the core of my personal productivity system and Trello as the back bone of work task management. I tend to gravitate toward simple systems and both Evernote and Trello deliver a simple, multi-device experience that’s easy to update and share. I keep a single Evernote note for my personal GTD tracking and use a Trello board for tracking work related projects. When I need to buckle down and focus I crank up the tunes and practice the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a> is my go to music app, but I spend a fair amount of time listening to <a href="https://www.focusatwill.com/">focus@will</a> (especially when I need to buckle down and get work done).</p>

<p>I’m fairly religious about a daily and weekly review which is less about tools and more about process.</p>

<p>When it comes to consuming information, I’m a huge fan of <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>. Throughout the week ,I’ll set articles for “read later” and usually set aside an hour or two on the weekends to read the content I bookmark throughout the week. This can definitely be a time suck, so it takes some discipline to use this technique wisely. About a year ago I started implementing the <a href="https://medium.com/life-hacks/9cbd3899b87">impending doom engine technique</a>, and so far it’s working well.</p>

<p>I’m also a big fan of <a href="http://quibb.com/">Quibb </a> for industry news and <a href="http://cir.ca/">Circa</a> (iOS) for news headlines. For design news, I use the awesome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/geisha-dribbble-layervaul/jhiocdmmaannaccoofjfmjpbfkogmnap">Geisha </a> plugin for Chrome which delivers fresh screenshots from <a href="http://dribbble.com/">Dribbble</a> and design news headlines from <a href="https://layervault.com/">LayerVault</a>.</p>

<p>For my design work, I use Adobe Creative Suite, <a href="http://www.axure.com/">Axure</a>, <a href="http://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>, <a href="https://redpen.io/">Red Pen</a>, <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a> and <a href="http://verifyapp.com/">Verify</a>. I also throw in a healthy mix of sketching and white boarding via photo uploads to Evernote using <a href="http://evernote.com/skitch/">Skitch</a>.</p>

<p>For coding, I use <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> and store my projects on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. I use <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox </a> when I need to fire up Windows for browser testing a la the Windows virtual machines available from <a href="http://modern.ie/">modern.IE</a>.</p>

<p>Must have utilities include <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>, <a href="http://dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm 2</a>, <a href="http://theolabrothers.com/sip/">Sip</a>, <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass </a> and <a href="http://www.xmarks.com/">Xmarks</a>.</p>

<h2 id="whats-your-dream-setup">What's your dream setup?</h2>

<p>Honestly, I’m pretty close to my dream setup. Five years ago I had a different answer but with the shift toward cloud storage and apps I’m a happy camper. I suppose the only thing I would like is a better way to quickly move photos between my iPhone and Mac (that’s still a clunky process).</p>

<p>I would love it if Spotify started offering ultra high-resolution streaming, but that’s a topic for a different day.</p>
