<p>My personal operating system is all about simplicity and efficiency. I want as few tools and steps as possible to get things done.</p>

<p>I use Outlook 2010 for work email. I have a simple system of classifying, flagging, and filing, that helps me remember things I need to do or to get back to someone when I’m waiting for them. I’ve added button to my <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/customize-the-quick-access-toolbar-HA010362102.aspx">Quick Access Toolbar</a> in Outlook so I can categorize and file messages into my <strong>To Do</strong> or <strong>Waiting For</strong> folders in a couple of clicks. I categorize messages with the name of the person involved if it’s on my team, plus I have categories for my main areas of focus (client teams support, ISP knowledge, mediation, Radar/data, M3AAWG). Prior to each 1:1, I go through all of the emails categorized with that person’s name, and that gives me a quick look at what I owe them or what they owe me. I have very few folders for filing mail. Instead of deleting mail, I archive it, so those messages still show up in conversation threads. I delete everything older than 90 days from my archive folder to keep Gerri happy, and I use <a href="http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/04/services/ems-email-management-services">EMS</a> if I need to dig up an old thread.</p>

<p>I take notes in a plain spiral bound notebook and flag actions in the margin with a big star. Sometimes I use <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/onenote/">OneNote</a> to take meeting notes, and the integration with Outlook is great. I can create tasks and reminders from within OneNote, and I can send emails from Outlook to OneNote if I want to file them forever. I do this for account information, instructions, things like that. Regardless of where I take my notes, I have to remember to look back at the actions and make sure I’m tracking them.</p>

<p>I track my team’s yearly/quarterly goals in Excel. I’m always looking for a way to do this better, as long as it’s <strong>SIMPLE</strong>.</p>

<p>For productivity, I loosely follow <a href="http://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/">Leo Babauta’s Zen to Done</a>, a simpler version of <a href="http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd">GTD</a>. I do a weekly review:
* check progress against my goals
* get updates from my team
* go back through meeting notes from the week and pull out any actions
* look at calendar for the next week and make sure I’m not double-booked, that I’m prepared for upcoming meetings, etc.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a> for FTP, <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> to store passwords, and I set up <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/subscribe-to-an-rss-feed-HA010355679.aspx">RSS in Outlook</a>.</p>

<p><strong>For work, that’s pretty much it—streamlined and simple.</strong></p>

<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>

<p>I keep personal and work separated as much as possible in order to support my work/life balance.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>I’m an Apple devotee with a white <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/">iPhone 5s</a>, a white <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/">iPad mini with Retina display (Wi-Fi)</a>, and a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/">MacBook Air (brand new, fully loaded)</a>. The MacBook Air recently replaced my <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/sp13">2007 “vintage” MacBook Pro</a>. The iPad is a bit superfluous but is handy as a portable device.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.com/B00AWH595M">Kindle Paperwhite (2nd generation)</a>—I have used a <a href="http://amzn.com/B0015T963C">Kindle 2</a> (2nd generation Kindle) for years, and I thought it couldn’t be improved upon. But when a family member recently dropped something heavy on it, I had to replace it. I would have bought another Kindle 2, but I was drawn to the background light on the Paperwhite, which is awesome and totally worth the upgrade.</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p><a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> for filing away all sorts of information—it’s <a href="http://appstore.com/evernote/evernote/">synced on my iPhone and iPad</a>, so I can always have the information at my fingertips. I keep my favorite recipes on here, articles I want to save, medical history for my family plus all information I might need if someone got hurt, favorite workouts, reading lists, etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> for marking something to read later—after I read it, if I like it and want to keep it, I then put it in Evernote.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a> for task management—I have a list for routine tasks so I remember to do them – it’s the only way I remember to clean the air filter every three months, pay bills weekly, get my flu shot, etc. I also keep my shopping list on RTM so any time I’m out I remember what I need to pick up. I hooked RTM up to <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/siri/">Siri</a> so she tells RTM when I ask her to remind me of something.</p>

<p><a href="http://digg.com/reader">Digg Reader</a> for personal blog reading—I seem to be the only person who doesn’t like <a href="http://feedly.com/">Feedly</a>.</p>
