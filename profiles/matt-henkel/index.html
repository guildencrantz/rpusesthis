        <h1>Matt Henkel</h1>
        <h2 id="who-are-you-and-what-do-you-do">Who are you, and what do you do?</h2>

<p>My name is Matt Henkel, and I'm a Software Engineer on the Anti-Phishing Solutions team. I started at RP in June 2007: I spent the first ten months working in Application Support before moving into a Software Engineering role on Campaign Preview—where I spent four crazy years. Prior to RP, I provided application support for StorageTek and PAR Tech.</p>

<p>My passion is meaning in data: helping with retrieval, architecting useful storage systems, finding hidden connections, and the like. To achieve this, I've been known to use pretty much any language, but lately I find myself coding largely in <a href="https://www.java.com/">Java</a>, <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, and <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> here at RP, and with personal projects largely in <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>, and <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a>.</p>

<p>Besides coding, I'm a foodie (eater and cook), <a href="https://untappd.com/user/guildencrantz">enjoyer of beer</a>, coffee snob, board game geek, and role playing nerd. My best friend is an eight-pound chihuahua (the dog they call <a href="http://firefly.wikia.com/wiki/Jayne_Cobb">Jayne</a>).</p>

<h2 id="what-hardware-do-you-use">What hardware do you use?</h2>

<p>I'm waiting for a replacement for my work laptop, but I currently have a <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/latitude-e4310/pd">Latitude E4310</a> upgraded to 8GB RAM with a dock and a pair of <a href="http://amzn.com/B007TNCMMU">Dell 2009wt monitors</a>. Being a laptop the keyboard is horrible so for the last four years I've been using a <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/wireless-keyboard-k350">Logitech K350 wireless keyboard</a> and <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/performance-mouse-mx">Logitech Wireless Performance Mouse MX</a> (not that the mouse gets much use). A key piece of hardware for me in the office environment is a good pair of headphones: I'm currently using <a href="http://en-us.sennheiser.com/monitoring-headphone-studio-professional-audio-hd-380-pro">Sennheiser HD 380 Pro</a> headphones. The biggest win in my hardware at RP is my desk: an adjustable sit/stand desk that saves my back.</p>

<p>I don't usually take my laptop out of the dock (unless I'm taking it home) as I also have an <a href="http://www.asus.com/Tablets_Mobile/ASUS_Transformer_Pad_TF700T/">ASUS Transformer Pad TF700T</a> which is an Android tablet with a removable keyboard, effectively letting me switch it between a tablet and a netbook.</p>

<p>My phone is a <a href="https://www.google.com/nexus/5/">black 32GB Nexus 5</a>. It's a solid phone, but most importantly it has <a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details/Nexus_Wireless_Charger?id=nexus_wireless_charger&amp;amp;hl=en">Qi wireless charging</a>. I currently have four Qi charging points between my house, car, and desk at RP. It's a bit shocking how removing the necessity to plug my phone in has improved my enjoyment of the device.</p>

<p>I also have two <a href="https://getpebble.com/">Pebble</a> smart watches (one original in grey, and one <a href="https://getpebble.com/steel">Pebble Steel</a> in brushed stainless steel) and recently acquired <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/">Google Glass</a> (Charcoal Glass with Split Tangerine frame). The watch has been quite convenient for providing small pieces of information in a subtle manner, however I still haven't figured out how Glass will integrate into my daily life.</p>

<h3 id="coffee">Coffee</h3>

<p>I'm a coffee nerd, and here's my setup:</p>

<h4 id="work">Work</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Beans</strong>: I recently stopped giving away my Starbucks gift cards and started using them to <a href="https://tonx.org/better">buy credit</a> with the <a href="https://tonx.org/">Tonx</a> subscription coffee service.
    <ul>
      <li>Normally it's a bit expensive, but by actually using the Starbucks cards the price is pretty good—and the coffee has been very good so far.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Grind</strong>: <a href="http://www.orphanespresso.com/Orphan-Espresso-Hand-Built-Coffee-Grinders_c_392.html">Orphan Espresso Lido</a>
    <ul>
      <li>This is by far the best portable manual grinder I've used. The nice large burr grinds quickly and easily while producing an extremely consistent grind.</li>
      <li>This isn't made any more, but it looks like <a href="http://www.oehandgrinders.com/OE-LIDO-2-Manual-Coffee-Grinder—PRE-ORDER_p_14.html">the v2 is available</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Brew</strong>: <a href="http://aerobie.com/products/aeropress.htm">aeropress</a> + <a href="http://www.kaffeologie.com/shop/s-filter-for-aeropress-coffee-makers">S Filter</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Consume</strong>: <a href="http://www.nostarch.com/mug.htm">Mug of Vi</a> because :x.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="home">Home</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Beans</strong>: I generally source my beans from local roasters such as <a href="https://www.pabloscoffee.com/">Pablo's</a> or defiant bean roasters—which has now merged with <a href="http://www.bonfirecoffee.com/">Bonfire Coffee</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Occasionally roast my own with greens from <a href="http://www.sweetmarias.com/">Sweet Maria's</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Grind</strong>: <a href="http://amzn.com/B00030IEJG">KitchenAid Pro Line Burr Grinder</a>
    <ul>
      <li>It appears that this is also a discontinued product (mine's nearly 8 years old now), but it's served me well for everything from french press to espresso.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Brew</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.gaggia.com/e/machines.manual.RI9301_11.overview.html">Gaggia Baby</a>
        <ul>
          <li>This is an entry-level espresso machine, but it's pretty hackable so you can easily improve the shot quality by replacing over pressure valve, and the make better foam by swapping out the wand.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.kitchenaid.com/shop/countertop-appliances-1/countertop-appliances-2/coffee-products-3/-[KCM0402ER]-401685/KCM0402ER/">KitchenAid Personal Coffee Maker</a>
        <ul>
          <li>Getting a good, large, cup of coffee in the morning can be hard, but this does a great job of brewing at a sane temperature—this producing a consistent cup on those days when I'm too rushed to make an espresso or a pour over.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Consume</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Six shots of espresso travel in my <a href="http://www.kinto.co.jp/en/products/drinkware/re_cup/">220ml ReCup</a></li>
      <li>Until ReCup comes out with a 500ml version (or the <a href="http://sprudge.com/first-look-new-glass-keep-cup.html">KeepCup Brew</a> comes out), I'm using a <a href="http://www.shopvesseldrinkware.com/collections/porcelain">12 oz porcelain travel mug from Vessel</a> (it's got a barrel of monkeys on it—I point this out because monkeys).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>All my machines (personal and currently work laptop) run <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch linux</a>. The core of my linux experience is my shell, which is currently <a href="http://www.zsh.org">ZSH</a>. I do not, however, run plain ZSH: I run <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a> in addition to having ZSH automatically start, or connect to, <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux</a>. Of course plain tmux isn't the prettiest or easiest to manage so I rely on <a href="https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline">Powerline</a> and <a href="https://github.com/treyhunner/tmuxstart">tmuxstart</a>.</p>

<h3 id="vim">vim</h3>

<p>As most of my time is spent editing text I spend most of my time in <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>. While vim is pretty excellent by itself it's better with plugins, so I have to call out at least a few plugins:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim">Vundle</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Manage your vim plugins easily. It also makes it easy to back them up and get them on other machines.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/myusuf3/numbers.vim">numbers</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Show the current line number, but provide relative numbers for the other lines</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular">Tabular</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Help keep things lined up nicely</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">fugitive</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Manage git from within vim</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1861">errormarker</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Get IDE style error notifications when you save a file</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-obsession">obsession</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Vim sessions are extremely useful, but a bit of a pain to manage manually. With obsession, it's now trivial to get the benefits of vim sessions—especially if you use the following function: <code>vim() { if [[ (( $# == 0 )) &amp;&amp; -f Session.vim ]] then /usr/bin/vim -S else /usr/bin/vim $@ fi }</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=356">dbext</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't wait 30 minutes for SQLDeveloper to load up so you can do a few quick queries, and don't fight with the horrible formatting of sqlplus: dbext shells out to the standard client for the target DB and then displays results in a new pane. You can even select and execute queries right from within your code.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kakkyz81/evervim">evervim</a>
    <ul>
      <li>I put freaking everything in Evernote, and this just makes that content easier to edit.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And since I do spend so much time in vim (or on the shell in vim mode, or somewhere else that's in vim mode), one of the things that I've done that's absolutely amazing is swapped my ESC and CAPS LOCK keys system-wide. I could keep on with vim, but that's a talk all its own.</p>

<h3 id="gui">GUI</h3>

<p>So far that's all been in a terminal, but sometimes it's helpful to have a GUI, and that's why I run <a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/">awesome</a>. Awesome is a hybrid window manager that I largely use in it's tiling mode. I've found that even though I was good at working virtual with desktops before, having a tiling manager has reduced the time I spend hunting for a window to effectively zero.</p>

<p>Now that there's a GUI, it's easier to admit that there are times when vim isn't the best solution and IDEs make sense (like when writing Java). When that's the case I use <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> with the <a href="http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164">IdeaVim plugin</a>.</p>

<h3 id="browser">Browser</h3>

<p>Of course, if I'm not editing text I'm probably in a browser. In my case that browser is <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/google-chrome-dev/">Chrome, Dev Channel</a>. Much like with vim, it's the plugins that really help the browser be awesome, and a few of the important ones I use are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://vimium.github.io/">Vimium</a>
    <ul>
      <li>I can even navigate most of the web without a mouse now.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg">The Great Suspender</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't let Chrome eat all your resources just because you might want to look at one of those 600 tabs again someday.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://evernote.com/webclipper/">Evernote Web Clipper</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Seriously, I use Evernote for just about everything. By default, I have Web Clipper add the tag <em>tl;dr</em>, so  one of my primary uses for the Clipper is to grab articles to read later. The other one is to grab recipes to make later.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proxy-switchysharp/dpplabbmogkhghncfbfdeeokoefdjegm">Proxy SwitchySharp</a>
    <ul>
      <li>I have SOCKS servers configured for each of our environments and then switching rules setup for those environments so that I can hit things like the web interface for the production AMQ boxes without doing a local forward and pointing the browser at localhost.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://getadblock.com/">AdBlock</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Because ads make things slow.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/javascript-blacklist/emcepjkdiiaenmoaghcfghjjppbkbhnf">JavaScript Blacklist</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Because some javascript is evil.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kindling-for-campfire/abnakpmgckdkcpgbcejajjbllagggcif">Kindling for Campfire</a>
    <ul>
      <li>When I have three rooms open side-by-side in different tiles, it's convenient to switch to minimal view.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromeipass/ompiailgknfdndiefoaoiligalphfdae">chromeIPass</a>
    <ul>
      <li>KeePass is the greatest application ever, and this extension makes it behave much like LastPass or 1Password in the browser environment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="passwords-and-other-important-things">Passwords (and other important things)</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, I use <a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a>. All my passwords and important text strings go in KeePass. KeePass has a few benefits over other services (such as LastPass and 1Password):</p>

<ol>
  <li>It's not hosted: my passwords don't go out to anybody else. The security is the same as the security to my systems.</li>
  <li>I can auto-type passwords into any window, not just web pages. I auto-type passwords into everything (including shells) based on window type and titles.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="sync">Sync</h3>

<p>One of the drawbacks of the "[i]t's not hosted" benefit is synchronization. Well, I'm a huge fan of <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/sync/">BitTorrent Sync</a> which allows you to automatically sync your files between your machines (even <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bittorrent.sync">Android</a>) without going through a third-party system—it's like Dropbox without Dropbox being able to see your stuff. I have all my passwords synced between three computers, my phone, and my tablet (I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.keepass">KeePassDroid</a> on the Android devices) without issue.</p>

<p>Speaking of sync, I also run <a href="https://www.insynchq.com/">Insync</a> to sync my Google Docs (both RP and personal) to my machines. I find this quite convenient because now I just store all my documents together and I don't have to worry about what's local and what's in the cloud.</p>

<h3 id="email">Email</h3>

<p>For email, I'm currently using <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> with <a href="http://exquilla.zendesk.com/">ExQuilla for Microsoft Exchange</a> and <a href="http://www.1st-setup.nl/wordpress/?page_id=133">Exchange EWS Provider</a> so I can access my corporate email and calendar (<em>when will we move to Gmail?</em>). Of course I need to have at least some vim bindings, so I also rely heavily on <a href="http://www.vimperator.org/muttator">Muttator</a>.</p>

<h3 id="git--ssh">Git &amp; SSH</h3>

<p>The stock apps that almost all of us use (like SSH and git) have some extremely useful features that it's well worth digging into the options of some of these tools we use so frequently:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Aliases">git aliases</a> are extremely powerful
    <ul>
      <li>Graph the commits: <code>lga = log —graph —pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)&lt;%an&gt;%Creset' —abbrev-commit —date=relative —branches —remotes —tags</code></li>
      <li>Push to gerrit and add reviewers automatically: <code>pra = push —receive-pack='git receive-pack —re greg.colburn@returnpath.net —re matthew.unwin@returnpath.net —re lee.gonzales@returnpath.net —re Les.Barstow@returnpath.net —re mike.naseef@returnpath.net' gerrit HEAD:refs/publish/master</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://nerderati.com/2011/03/simplify-your-life-with-an-ssh-config-file/">SSH config</a> can be used to accomplish magic
    <ul>
      <li>You can use ProxyCommand and (if you have keys setup) automatically hop through gateway boxes with <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/nc">nc</a>:</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<pre><code>Host *.tst
User mhenkel
ProxyCommand ssh -q stage.tst.returnpath.net nc %h.lan 22
</code></pre>

<h3 id="mobile">Mobile</h3>

<p>My Nexus 5 is stock 4.4.2 (rooted) running the <a href="http://getaviate.com/">Vviate</a> launcher and <a href="https://www.coverscreen.com/">Cover</a> lock screen. The more location aware my phone is, the happier I am, and these two pieces of software really help make sure that I can quickly access what I need (and because there are things I always want quick access to I also run <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fb.looprtaskswitcher">loopr</a>). In keeping with the location aware (and time aware) stuff, I've also programmed out a fair few actions (such as launching <a href="https://www.waze.com/">Waze</a> when I get in my car or silencing my phone and launching <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onemightyroar.lantern">Lantern: A Campfire Client</a> when I get to the office) using <a href="http://tasker.dinglisch.net/">Tasker</a>. Do I even need to mention <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>?</p>

<p>I'm also a big fan of seamlessly collecting stats about my life and as such I use both <a href="http://www.moves-app.com/">Moves</a> and <a href="http://www.automatic.com/">Automatic</a>.</p>

<p>My tablet is running <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/">CyanogenMod</a> 10.2.1 (Android 4.3.1): no fancy lock screen or replacement launcher here. Other than Chrome, my most used piece of software on the tablet is probably <a href="https://sonelli.com/">JuiceSSH</a>. That being said, I do read on this a fair bit (with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.books">Google Play Books</a>), and watch TV via <a href="https://plex.tv/">Plex</a>.</p>

<p>On my Pebble I'm running <a href="http://pebblecanvas.blogspot.com/">Canvas</a> in app mode with data about the time, weather, and my next calendar event.</p>

<p>On Glass so far the <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/">Hangouts</a> app has been my most used (besides the camera), but I recently got <a href="http://www.shopxglass.co/">shop [X]</a> and have been in some discussions about presentation (PowerPoint, Google Presentations) controllers. Sadly, while I can send stuff from Glass to Evernote, I can't query Evernote from glass; I'm sure it's coming, but it's not there yet.</p>

<h2 id="what-would-be-your-dream-setup">What would be your dream setup?</h2>

<p>I don't know what I don't know, so it's hard to say. Other than not yet having a really good task management solution across my devices, I'm generally pretty happy with my software situation. I'd love to see Glass extended more so I can do more without my hands. Additionally, I'd also love to see a device like the <a href="http://www.asus.com/in-search-of-incredible/us-en/asus-transformer-book-trio/">Asus Transformer Book Trio</a> which runs Linux and Android; ometimes I want a laptop and sometimes I want a tablet, but I never want to carry both. Oh, and an <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/performance-work-chairs/aeron-chairs.html">Aeron</a> chair: I'd love to have an Aeron chair at RP again.</p>
