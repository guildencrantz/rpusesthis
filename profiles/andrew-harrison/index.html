        <h1>Andrew Harrison</h1>
        <h1 id="who-are-you-and-what-do-you-do">Who are you, and what do you do?</h1>

<p>"Software Engineer, futurist, technologist, outdoor enthusiast, husband and father of 2" is what my LinkedIn profile says, which is accurate, if not a bit terse. I knew from a young age that my interests were in computers. I was the kid in elementary school who would rush to finish his in-class homework before the bus came to sneak in a few minutes of time on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II</a>. My first language was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>, which I started tinkering with in 5th grade. I spent my first $900 to buy a used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Classic_II">Macintosh Classic II</a> in 1992 from my high school math teacher, Mr. Brown, who also got me excited about mathematics.</p>

<p>Growing up in a small farm community in rural southwest Nebraska, I had no desire to get lost on a giant University campus, and so found what turned out to be a perfect college for me in <a href="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/">Rose-Hulman</a>, situated on the outskirts of 'lovely' Terre Haute, Indiana. After graduating with a dual-major in Computer Science and Mathematics, I took a job in Indianapolis at Software Artistry, the company I had already been introduced to through my Senior project and co- op work.</p>

<p>By the end of college I had become fluent in <a href="https://www.java.com/">Java</a>, the language I've focused almost exclusively on for the past 14 years. The software industry in Indiana was quite run-of-the-mill as far as exciting work goes, and after struggling to find jobs anywhere outside of the insurance industry, I looked elsewhere, setting my sights on Colorado, where I found ColdSpark, a small company trying to make it big in email.</p>

<p>After 4 exciting years at ColdSpark, I did what many others from that company did, and found my way down the street to Return Path, where I will be celebrating my 4-year anniversary next month. Having the opportunity to transfer domain-knowledge can be rare in the software space, and it was refreshing to be able to start a new job at RP with some experience already in the email space.</p>

<p>I've bounced around quite a bit at Return Path, working at times on versions of InboxMonitor, InboxPreview, RNBL, SenderScore, and the project that became Inbox Insight. After the OtherInbox acquisition, I was presented the opportunity to join their Engineering group, working on what has ultimately become the Data Pipeline team, picking up the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> programming language along the way, to great joy. Ultimately, my family and I decided that we would take a plunge and choose a change of scenery, and we closed on our house in Austin last July.</p>

<h1 id="what-hardware-do-you-use">What hardware do you use?</h1>

<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>My dev box is a <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/p/xps-13-9333/pd">Dell XPS 13</a>, with a solid-state drive, running <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint 15</a>. I also have to pair that with a set of <a href="http://www.skullcandy.com/shop/inkd">SkullCandy Ink'd</a> headphones (I have black, red, and gray). Oddly, I find some days I can't concentrate if I don't have headphones on, even if no music is playing. Oh, and a good ergonomic wireless mouse, as close in shape as possible to the <a href="http://amzn.com/B00005BAUL">IBM 19K2002</a> (I've worn two of those out over the years).</p>

<h2 id="home">Home</h2>
<p>I tend to favor <a href="http://www.asus.com/">ASUS</a> brand hardware, buying barebones machines and then assembling them when they arrive in the mail. Our latest family "desktop" purchase was an ASUS laptop, running, sadly, Windows. As for smartphones, I run Android.</p>

<p>My most recent purchase was a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> which came in the mail last week. I have plans to have it running Google Calendar, attached to a screen mounted near the kitchen.</p>

<p>For the kids, we've purchased Bo &amp; Yana from <a href="https://www.play-i.com/">Play-i</a>, but they've yet to be shipped. I'm really looking forward to teaching my 2- and 4-year-old how to program robots.</p>

<p>Other hardware of note:
* <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe">Apple IIe</a>
* Macintosh Classic II (yes, the same one)
* <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation_5">SPARCstation 5</a>
* <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Fire">Sun Fire</a> X4100
* <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/slr_cameras/eos_rebel_t3i_18_55mm_is_ii_lens_kit">Canon Rebel T3i</a>
* <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/5/">Galaxy Nexus</a> (currently the 4, but will be getting the 5 once my contract is up shortly)
* <a href="http://www.skagen.com/store/Skagen/en_US/shop/mens/mens_watches.html">Skagen</a> watch (Titanium 205LTXN)
* <a href="http://www.adidas.com/us/product/mens-running-kanadia-trail-6-shoes/IET62">Adidas Kanadia TR</a> running shoes (I wore out two model 3s, wearing a model 4 now, and have a model 5 in the closet.)</p>

<h1 id="what-software-do-you-use">What software do you use?</h1>

<p>Primarily I'm in a Linux environment, preferably a flavor of <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. I exclusively use <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/â€Ž">Chrome</a> for browsing, and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine</a> IDEs for software development. For really hairy diffs, and especially when comparing folder/file structure, I use <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/moreinfo.php">Beyond Compare</a>. And yes, I'm an <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> guy.</p>

<p>Online, one notable app I've come to love is <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>. You should check it out.</p>
