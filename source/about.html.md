## What is this?

RP Uses This is a collection of profiles of the diverse members of the Return Path team. The question we're trying to answer: what do you use to get the job done?

## Who made this?

[Andy Smith](http://rpfaces.returnpath.net/andy.smith) (UX Designer) designed and created the site, and [Hoon Park](http://rpfaces.returnpath.net/hoon.park) (Support Ops Manager) collected and edited the profiles. This was created during the 2014 Q1 RP Hackathon.

## Where did the idea come from?

There was a group of people who were working on coming up with some standards or suggestions to the rest of the company on tools they could use to increase productivity. We thought a site like this might be a fascinating look into how different people in the company get stuff done both at work and at home.

## How was it made?

The site uses the [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) static site generator and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). We used SASS as our CSS preprocessor and a stripped down version of [Twitter Bootstrap for SASS](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass).

## Can I write a profile?

**Yes!** Feel free to send one to [Hoon](mailto:hoon.park@returnpath.com?Subject=I%20wrote%20a%20RP%20Uses%20This%20profile) and he will make sure it gets on the site. Don't feel like you have to add a bunch of links. He will let you know if he needs any additional information.

## Hey! Where is Hoon's profile?

Writing one took longer than expected, and he needed to finish the Hackathon project on time to make the video. It will be coming soon.
