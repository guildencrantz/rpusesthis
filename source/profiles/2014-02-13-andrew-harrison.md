## Who are you, and what do you do?

"Software Engineer, futurist, technologist, outdoor enthusiast, husband and father of 2" is what my LinkedIn profile says, which is accurate, if not a bit terse. I knew from a young age that my interests were in computers. I was the kid in elementary school who would rush to finish his in-class homework before the bus came to sneak in a few minutes of time on the [Apple II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II). My first language was [BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC), which I started tinkering with in 5th grade. I spent my first $900 to buy a used [Macintosh Classic II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Classic_II) in 1992 from my high school math teacher, Mr. Brown, who also got me excited about mathematics.

Growing up in a small farm community in rural southwest Nebraska, I had no desire to get lost on a giant University campus, and so found what turned out to be a perfect college for me in [Rose-Hulman](http://www.rose-hulman.edu/), situated on the outskirts of 'lovely' Terre Haute, Indiana. After graduating with a dual-major in Computer Science and Mathematics, I took a job in Indianapolis at Software Artistry, the company I had already been introduced to through my Senior project and co- op work.

By the end of college I had become fluent in [Java](https://www.java.com/), the language I've focused almost exclusively on for the past 14 years. The software industry in Indiana was quite run-of-the-mill as far as exciting work goes, and after struggling to find jobs anywhere outside of the insurance industry, I looked elsewhere, setting my sights on Colorado, where I found ColdSpark, a small company trying to make it big in email.

After 4 exciting years at ColdSpark, I did what many others from that company did, and found my way down the street to Return Path, where I will be celebrating my 4-year anniversary next month. Having the opportunity to transfer domain-knowledge can be rare in the software space, and it was refreshing to be able to start a new job at RP with some experience already in the email space.

I've bounced around quite a bit at Return Path, working at times on versions of InboxMonitor, InboxPreview, RNBL, SenderScore, and the project that became Inbox Insight. After the OtherInbox acquisition, I was presented the opportunity to join their Engineering group, working on what has ultimately become the Data Pipeline team, picking up the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) programming language along the way, to great joy. Ultimately, my family and I decided that we would take a plunge and choose a change of scenery, and we closed on our house in Austin last July.

## What hardware do you use?

### Work
My dev box is a [Dell XPS 13](http://www.dell.com/us/p/xps-13-9333/pd), with a solid-state drive, running [Linux Mint 15](http://www.linuxmint.com/). I also have to pair that with a set of [SkullCandy Ink'd](http://www.skullcandy.com/shop/inkd) headphones (I have black, red, and gray). Oddly, I find some days I can't concentrate if I don't have headphones on, even if no music is playing. Oh, and a good ergonomic wireless mouse, as close in shape as possible to the [IBM 19K2002](http://amzn.com/B00005BAUL) (I've worn two of those out over the years).

### Home
I tend to favor [ASUS](http://www.asus.com/) brand hardware, buying barebones machines and then assembling them when they arrive in the mail. Our latest family "desktop" purchase was an ASUS laptop, running, sadly, Windows. As for smartphones, I run Android.

My most recent purchase was a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) which came in the mail last week. I have plans to have it running Google Calendar, attached to a screen mounted near the kitchen.

For the kids, we've purchased Bo & Yana from [Play-i](https://www.play-i.com/), but they've yet to be shipped. I'm really looking forward to teaching my 2- and 4-year-old how to program robots.

Other hardware of note:

* [Apple IIe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe)
* Macintosh Classic II (yes, the same one)
* [SPARCstation 5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation_5)
* [Sun Fire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Fire) X4100
* [Canon Rebel T3i](http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/slr_cameras/eos_rebel_t3i_18_55mm_is_ii_lens_kit)
* [Galaxy Nexus](http://www.google.com/nexus/5/) (currently the 4, but will be getting the 5 once my contract is up shortly)
* [Skagen](http://www.skagen.com/store/Skagen/en_US/shop/mens/mens_watches.html) watch (Titanium 205LTXN)
* [Adidas Kanadia TR](http://www.adidas.com/us/product/mens-running-kanadia-trail-6-shoes/IET62) running shoes (I wore out two model 3s, wearing a model 4 now, and have a model 5 in the closet.)

## What software do you use?

Primarily I'm in a Linux environment, preferably a flavor of [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/). I exclusively use [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/â€Ž) for browsing, and [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and [RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) IDEs for software development. For really hairy diffs, and especially when comparing folder/file structure, I use [Beyond Compare](http://www.scootersoftware.com/moreinfo.php). And yes, I'm an [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) guy.

Online, one notable app I've come to love is [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/). You should check it out.
