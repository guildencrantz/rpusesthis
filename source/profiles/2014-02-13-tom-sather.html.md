## Who are you?

My name is Tom Sather, and I am Senior Director of Research at Return Path. I run our content marketing program which includes things like research papers, ebooks, and webinars to demonstrate Return Path’s expertise in email.

My iPhone 5s is essentially a part of my body at this point, so a lot of my productivity tools are mobile apps. I also use a MacBook for all design work and data analysis since it’s extremely capable of large tasks that PCs struggle with.

## What apps do you use?

### Mail
* [Apple Mail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_(application))
* Gmail

### Calendar

* [Tempo](https://www.tempo.ai/) – intelligent calendar using technology from [SRI](http://www.sri.com/)

### Productivity

On my iPhone, I have a folder specifically called “Get Sh*t Done” which includes:

* [ActionMethod](https://www.actionmethod.com/) – Adobe bought this so I’m afraid they will ignore it, but it’s great for getting quick ideas and to-dos down. Definitely my #1 used app for managing tasks
* [Reminders](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4970)
* [Boxer](http://www.getboxer.com/)
* [SmartSheet](http://www.smartsheet.com/) – mainly for work things. Love that it has a calendar feature which allows me to subscribe and sync across many calendars like Google or Outlook.
* [Any.do](http://www.any.do/)
* [Trello](https://trello.com/)
* [TIME Planner](http://timeplannerapp.com/)
* [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) – great for contextual reminders of things I need to do

I also have a folder for ideation apps (specifically apps to jot ideas down):

* [Moleskine Journal](http://mymoleskine.moleskine.com/community/mymoleskine_apps.php)
* [MindMeister](http://www.mindmeister.com/)
* [Evernote](http://evernote.com/) – most used since I can take photos of handwritten notes, etc.

### Travel

Since I frequently travel, I rely on a lot of travel apps to make sure I get where I am suppose to go, and to discover places in new cities:

* [TripIt](https://www.tripit.com/) – organizes every aspect of my travel and reminds me when to check-in etc.
* [BestOf](http://bestof.voiceplaces.com/)
* [United Airlines](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/united-airlines/id449945214)
* [Hipmunk](http://www.hipmunk.com/)
* [Jetsetter](http://www.jetsetter.com/)
* [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/)
* [Uber](https://www.uber.com/)
* [App in the Air](http://i.appintheair.mobi/)
* [GateGuru](http://www.gateguru.com/)
* Car Rental
* [Triposo](http://www.triposo.com/)

### Cloud Storage (both mobile and desktop)

These allow me to quickly find files to share with others, whether I’m at my desk or out on the road:

* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
* Google Drive
* [CloudMagic](https://cloudmagic.com/)

### BrainHacking

I use these apps to make sure that I can train my brain to get **MORE** stuff done and remember more stuff:

* Recorder (records EEGs)
* [Lumosity](http://www.lumosity.com/)
* [Cerego](http://cerego.com/)
* [BrainCopter](http://braincopter.weebly.com/)

### Social Media

* [Buffer](https://bufferapp.com/) – allows me to fill up a buffer of social updates

### Automation

* [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) – I use this for everything: automating lights to turn on at sunset, sync social updates across many sites, back up files and images, and more.
