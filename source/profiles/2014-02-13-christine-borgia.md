# Work

My personal operating system is all about simplicity and efficiency. I want as few tools and steps as possible to get things done.

I use Outlook 2010 for work email. I have a simple system of classifying, flagging, and filing, that helps me remember things I need to do or to get back to someone when I’m waiting for them. I’ve added button to my [Quick Access Toolbar](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/customize-the-quick-access-toolbar-HA010362102.aspx) in Outlook so I can categorize and file messages into my **To Do** or **Waiting For** folders in a couple of clicks. I categorize messages with the name of the person involved if it’s on my team, plus I have categories for my main areas of focus (client teams support, ISP knowledge, mediation, Radar/data, M3AAWG). Prior to each 1:1, I go through all of the emails categorized with that person’s name, and that gives me a quick look at what I owe them or what they owe me. I have very few folders for filing mail. Instead of deleting mail, I archive it, so those messages still show up in conversation threads. I delete everything older than 90 days from my archive folder to keep Gerri happy, and I use [EMS](http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/04/services/ems-email-management-services) if I need to dig up an old thread.

I take notes in a plain spiral bound notebook and flag actions in the margin with a big star. Sometimes I use [OneNote](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/onenote/) to take meeting notes, and the integration with Outlook is great. I can create tasks and reminders from within OneNote, and I can send emails from Outlook to OneNote if I want to file them forever. I do this for account information, instructions, things like that. Regardless of where I take my notes, I have to remember to look back at the actions and make sure I’m tracking them.

I track my team’s yearly/quarterly goals in Excel. I’m always looking for a way to do this better, as long as it’s **SIMPLE**.

For productivity, I loosely follow [Leo Babauta’s Zen to Done](http://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/), a simpler version of [GTD](http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd). I do a weekly review:
* check progress against my goals
* get updates from my team
* go back through meeting notes from the week and pull out any actions
* look at calendar for the next week and make sure I’m not double-booked, that I’m prepared for upcoming meetings, etc.

I use [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) for FTP, [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) to store passwords, and I set up [RSS in Outlook](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/subscribe-to-an-rss-feed-HA010355679.aspx).

**For work, that’s pretty much it—streamlined and simple.**

# Personal

I keep personal and work separated as much as possible in order to support my work/life balance.

## Hardware

I’m an Apple devotee with a white [iPhone 5s](http://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/), a white [iPad mini with Retina display (Wi-Fi)](http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/), and a [MacBook Air (brand new, fully loaded)](http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/). The MacBook Air recently replaced my [2007 “vintage” MacBook Pro](http://support.apple.com/kb/sp13). The iPad is a bit superfluous but is handy as a portable device.

[Kindle Paperwhite (2nd generation)](http://amzn.com/B00AWH595M)—I have used a [Kindle 2](http://amzn.com/B0015T963C) (2nd generation Kindle) for years, and I thought it couldn’t be improved upon. But when a family member recently dropped something heavy on it, I had to replace it. I would have bought another Kindle 2, but I was drawn to the background light on the Paperwhite, which is awesome and totally worth the upgrade.

## Software

[Evernote](http://evernote.com/) for filing away all sorts of information—it’s [synced on my iPhone and iPad](http://appstore.com/evernote/evernote/), so I can always have the information at my fingertips. I keep my favorite recipes on here, articles I want to save, medical history for my family plus all information I might need if someone got hurt, favorite workouts, reading lists, etc.

[Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) for marking something to read later—after I read it, if I like it and want to keep it, I then put it in Evernote.

[Remember the Milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/) for task management—I have a list for routine tasks so I remember to do them – it’s the only way I remember to clean the air filter every three months, pay bills weekly, get my flu shot, etc. I also keep my shopping list on RTM so any time I’m out I remember what I need to pick up. I hooked RTM up to [Siri](http://www.apple.com/ios/siri/) so she tells RTM when I ask her to remind me of something.

[Digg Reader](http://digg.com/reader) for personal blog reading—I seem to be the only person who doesn’t like [Feedly](http://feedly.com/).
