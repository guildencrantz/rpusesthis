## Who Am I?
My name is Rosemary Walsh and I am on the Service Operations team in New York working to improve and streamline service efficiencies. Previously at Return Path I have been both an Account Manager and a Client Success Expert. Before coming to Return Path, I worked at two different ESPs – [WhatCounts](http://www.whatcounts.com/) and [Fishbowl](http://www.fishbowl.com/).

## What Hardware Do I Use?
I use a Dell notebook that runs Windows for work. I have a [black, 16GB Wi-Fi iPad 2](https://www.apple.com/ipad-2/specs/) at home. My iPad is always in a [DODOcase I customized](http://www.dodocase.com/products/dodocase-custom-cases) to be Hot Coral on the outside, Teal on the inside, with a Gray elastic. I also use a [gold, 16GB iPhone 5s](https://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/). I also use my [Canon EOS Rebel T1i](http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/eos_slr_camera_systems/eos_digital_slr_cameras/eos_rebel_t1i_ef_s_18_55mm_is_kit) (with both the standard [EF-S 17-55 f/2.8 IS USM](http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_s_17_55_f_2_8_is_usm) lens and a [EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III USM](http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_75_300mm_f_4_5_6_iii_usm) telephoto zoom lens) for taking digital photos, but have found myself using the iPhone camera more and more as the quality of the camera improves.

## What Software Do I Use?

As organization and documentation are key to success in my role, I spend a lot of time using Google products. I use [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) for my web browser, which I especially enjoy because I can login on different computers and have access to the same bookmarks, passwords, etc. I also rely heavily on Google Drive for the docs and spreadsheets, as well as my Google Calendar. Google Hangouts is my preferred means of online communication. I like that it stores all of your chats so that you can go back and look through the history. I find that I do this a lot when I know that I talked to someone about something but can’t remember the exact details. I have Google Hangouts integrated with [Trillian](https://www.trillian.im/) to be able to chat with all Return Path folks.

For tracking projects and status updates, I follow along [Trello](https://trello.com/‎) but find it ineffective for my own day to day use. Instead, I find myself typing notes in [Notepad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad_(software)) daily. I spend a lot of time in Salesforce, and especially enjoy the ability to stay connected with others through [Chatter](https://www.salesforce.com/chatter/overview/‎). During the day, I usually listen to [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/), although I enjoying listening to [Rainy Cafe](http://rainycafe.com/) and [Rainy Mood](http://www.rainymood.com/) to help focus (you may have seen me Chatter about that). I am a big fan of [Inbox Zero](http://inboxzero.com/) at work, but I have over 900 emails in my personal Gmail account and have [purchased additional storage](https://www.google.com/settings/storage) for the photos, documents, etc.

I like to rely on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) on the web, [my phone, and my tablet](https://about.twitter.com/products/list) for my news updates and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) for photo updates. I use [Amazon Prime](http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Services-LLC-Prime/dp/B00DBYBNEE) for [streaming shows](http://www.amazon.com/Prime-Instant-Video/b?node=2676882011) and the free shipping, of course! I recently got a [Chromecast](http://www.google.com/intl/en-US/chrome/devices/chromecast/), although have so far found it ineffective since it has a limited number of apps that it can stream.

When running I use the [MapMyRun](http://www.mapmyrun.com/) app for tracking my route, accompanied by Spotify or [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com/) for the music. I also have the [Moves](http://www.moves-app.com/) app constantly running on my phone in the background to track my movements (walking the dog, walks to the train, etc.) It’s amazing how much you move in a given day!

I am in the midst of planning my wedding, so I also spend a good amount of personal time on Google Drive to share documents with my fiancé or family and friends. I created a [Google Form](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/87809) to collect addresses that then fed the data into a Google Sheet. This was a major time saver! I also use [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) for inspiration, as well as recipes for home. I have used [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com/) a lot recently for uploading and editing photos.
