Here are some things that I believe help me get stuff done:

# "Hard" systems (hardware & software)

I have a [Samsung Note 3](http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/galaxynote3-gear/). I get a lot of ribbing about it being a ludicrously large phone. It is. But it is nice that I can read on it easily and really do full emailing without squinting. It's like a mini-tablet.

I also have a [16GB Wi-F I Google Nexus 10](http://www.google.com/nexus/10/) and a [16GB Wi-F I iPad Air](https://www.apple.com/ipad-air/). Sometimes, I wish I had more space on the iPad, but I don’t really use the Nexus tab for storage-hogging stuff. I don't really use the iPad much to get real stuff done. I find the Nexus a reliable workhorse tablet for emailing, calendaring, and general work stuff.

I have a custom PC home system (Intel Core2 Quad Processor Q8400 running at 2.66 GHz) with [Windows 7 Home Premium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7_editions) (no way I'm going to 8), 4GB RAM, and a [NVIDIA 8800 Geforce GT](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-8800-gt) graphics card. The only thing notable about my home computer set up are Logitech headphones and a [Logitech HD Pro Webcam C920](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/hd-pro-webcam-c920) with [Carl Zeiss](http://lenses.zeiss.com/) optics that allows for very good [Skype](http://www.skype.com/) and [Google Hangouts](http://www.google.com/hangouts/) video calls. And, a nice fat data stream from [Time Warner Cable](http://www.timewarnercable.com/) that gives 50+ MBps down and about 5 up. I have a Dell laptop from Return Path that is *meh* from a hardware perspective but boots fast (flash drive), so that's nice.

From a software perspective, my life revolves around my inbox and calendar in MS Outlook on all my devices. I haven't had time to really get Outlook set up smoothly yet at RP, and I am certainly not a successful [inbox zero](http://inboxzero.com/) sort of guy. However, my inbox usually hovers around 100-200, and those are waiting to be filed(thus, the need to keep developing my Outlook filing structure). I also like [Evernote](http://evernote.com/) quite a bit. I am increasingly turning to the Google cloud for my software operating system, particularly for the web, cloud storage, calendaring, and personal email and now also for social connectivity at work (Google Hangouts). I'm finding the [Google Now](http://www.google.com/landing/now/) cards pretty useful, especially the time-to-destination information. I try to run most of my life device agnostic and just focused on cloud apps and email systems for device-neutrality.

I use [Viber](http://www.viber.com/) for communicating with my wife. I somewhat infrequently use [Trillian](https://www.trillian.im/) for IM, mostly to my EC colleagues. I have to admit I'm not a diligent Salesforce [Chatter](https://www.salesforce.com/chatter/) user. Google Cloud is a bit tricky considering I have an RP account now and have been using a personal account for years. It does seem that Google is making improvements on [hot-switching between accounts](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1721977), though.

Then, there are our People SaaS systems—[Workday](http://www.workday.com/), [Jobvite](http://recruiting.jobvite.com/), [Intacct](http://intacct.com/)—and cool internal apps like [RP Faces](http://rpfaces.returnpath.net/). I use the ones I have to when I have to, and RP Faces has been a great way to get to know people.

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) is my go-to social media app, especially [on my phone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.linkedin.android). I get feeds of interesting reading material through LinkedIn and it is the only thing I use for work-based social connectivity. I drive my social media presence through LinkedIn as well.

I still really like the phone—highly efficient, particularly for one-on-ones. When not in person, I probably communicate most by email, second most by phone or Skype/GoogleHangout, third by IM (Trillian), and a distant fourth by texting on my phone.

# "Soft" systems (skill and behaviors)

The most valuable class I had in junior high school was [touch typing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing). I type fast (75 WPM). That has always been a huge part of my operating system.

I don't compartmentalize my work/life. This is good and bad. I am on work email from when I get up in the morning until when I go to bed. I do not think I'm ever rude or distracted with my friends or family, but I make an effort of always being available for short correspondences, no matter the day or time (usually over email or Trillian). And, that's a reasonable expectation for my role—I don't expect the same from my reports.

Since I've been part of a couple of startups, I have never had the luxury of big-organization admin support. As a consequence, I've had to get pretty disciplined about managing my own calendar, notes, and to-do lists.

I don't think I take enough advantage of things like speech recognition and some of the full capacity of the software systems I do use. I think I could be far more effective if I did.
