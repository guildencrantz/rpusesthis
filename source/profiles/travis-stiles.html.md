## Who are you?

I'm Travis Stiles, and I'm Director of User Experience.

I like to solve problems for real people, by making products effective, efficient and enjoyable.

**Hardware I use**: a Macbook Pro, whiteboards, paper sketches, [Sharpie](http://www.sharpie.com/) permanent markers, [IPEVO camera](http://www.ipevo.com/) for sharing sketches

**Software I use**: [Photoshop](http://www.photoshop.com/), [Evernote](http://evernote.com/) (for notes) but moving to [Trello](https://trello.com/) for my personal [Kanban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) board todo list (shareable is nice), I live off Google [Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drawings](http://www.google.com/drive/apps.html) for flow diagrams, [Silverback](http://silverbackapp.com/) for feedback sessions, [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com/) to groove to
