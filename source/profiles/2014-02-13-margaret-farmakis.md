## Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is Margaret Farmakis and I’m the VP of Professional Services. I’ve worked at Return Path for seven years, and I manage a global team of expert consultants focused on solving our clients’ most challenging strategic problems as they relate to optimizing their email programs. I’ve worked from three Return Path offices, starting out in the New York office, helping to open the London office, and now working from our Sunnyvale office.

## What hardware do you use?

* Standard issue RP hardware: laptop, phone
* a [TANDBERG](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/telepresence/ttg.html) phone in my office in Sunnyvale (My team is spread out across multiple time zones in the US, Europe and Brazil, so this is a great way to stay connected, but the primary way I communicate is email, phone and IM.)
* mobile phone: [Motorola DROID 4](http://www.motorola.com/us/DROID-4-by-Motorola/88569.html) (I need a slide-out keyboard and I don't love iPhones)
* wireless internet card: [4G LTE Jetpack](http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/device/mobile-hotspot) on the Verizon network (I can work while I commute on the train from San Francisco to Sunnyvale three times a week.)

## What software do you use?

* MS Office (mostly Outlook, Word, Excel & PowerPoint – I basically dream in PowerPoint)
* Google Docs (great for some things, but a real pain when it comes to complex spreadsheets with multiple tabs)
* Google Hangouts
* [Adobe Connect](http://www.adobe.com/products/adobeconnect.html) (This is my favorite way to have a large group video conference so far. I'm in the process of getting a license for my team as I think it's much better than ReadyTalk and Google Hangouts.)
* [Snagit](http://www.techsmith.com/snagit.html) (I take a lot of screenshots)
* AIM/[Trillian](https://www.trillian.im/)
* ReadyTalk Quick Launcher (helps with common RT issue)
* Firefox (almost always)
* IE (sometimes; I use IE for GPPS and Firefox for Gmail so I can stay logged on to both at the same time. Also, I have more favorites in IE so sometimes just default to that for certain websites.)
* Wiki (a necessary evil)
* Skype
* Dropbo
* iTunes (although I’m an Android fan)

## Other random stuff

In terms of life, I don’t know how I ever survived without Google Maps on a smartphone. I have a terrible sense of direction and I travel a lot, so this is essential.

I also read a ton, but don’t currently have a Kindle because I still like the feeling of turning actual pages and adding completed books to my home library.

I’m in the market for a tablet or very light-weight laptop for personal travel, especially since I’ll be taking my sabbatical this year!

I’ll all about green tea (not coffee) and love my innovative loose leaf tea strainer/brewer (Teavana Perfect TeaMaker), plus their tea is delicious and the have an incredible selection. I happen to love a combination of  green and mint tea combination. This is a great for people who want the benefits of green tea but don't like the taste of it. For example, at work when I make tea, I use both a green tea bag and a mint tea bag in the same cup.
